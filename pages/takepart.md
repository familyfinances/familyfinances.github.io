**Family Finances Monthly Newsletter**

Families have been central to our study, and we want to make sure we can feed back our findings to those who participated in the research, as well as to others living on a low income. Our monthly **Family Finances Newsletter** shares updates from the study, opportunities to get involved, and news about what we’re learning and how we’re working to share the findings more widely.

The newsletter may also be of interest to professionals, including researchers, practitioners, policy experts, and others interested in the Scottish Child Payment and cash transfers more generally.

Whether you’re a research participant, a professional working with families, or someone interested in how financial support shapes everyday life, the newsletter is a simple way to stay connected. We send one email each month, and you can unsubscribe at any time.
