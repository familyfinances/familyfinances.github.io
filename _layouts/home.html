    <h1>Welcome to the Family<br>Finances Project</h1>
    <p>What difference does cash support for children make? Family Finances is a collaborative project with academics and policy partners at the University of Glasgow, University of York, the London School of Economics, and the Child Poverty Action Group. We are investigating the impact of the Scottish Child Payment on financial and emotional wellbeing and employment using a comparative, mixed-methods approach. Our project is funded by the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, and the Cost of Living Research Group at the University of York.
