What difference does cash support for children make? Family Resources is a collaborative project with academics at the University of Glasgow, University of York, London School of Economics and Child Poverty Action Group. We are investigating the impact of the Scottish Child Payment on financial and emotional wellbeing and employment using a comparative, mixed-methods approach. Our project is funded by the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, and the Cost of Living Research Group at the University of York.
