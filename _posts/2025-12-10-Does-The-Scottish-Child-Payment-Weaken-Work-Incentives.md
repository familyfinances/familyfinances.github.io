The Scottish Child Payment (SCP), introduced in 2021, provides cash transfers for families with children receiving Universal Credit (UC) or related benefits. The eligibility link to UC can create a potential cliff-edge at that threshold of eligibility - the decision to work one more hour can potentially result in a large loss of benefits. We study whether in practice the SCP creates disincentives to work. We begin by running simulations to understand where the SCP cliff-edge becomes binding; i.e. where it sits in relation to hypothetical labour market earnings. We find that a lone parent or sole earner in a couple could work at least 39 hours per week at national minimum wage before reaching the cliff-edge, and much more for some family structures, indicating no binding disincentive for these earners. Secondary earners face a more relevant constraint, with the cliff-edge presenting at 9 hours for families not claiming housing support. For secondary earners claiming housing support, again the cliff-edge is located above fulltime earnings for minimum wage earners. We go on to test the causal effect of SCP on labour market participation and hours worked directly, using a difference-in-difference methodology which compares families in Scotland with similar comparison families in England before and after the policy’s roll-out. Results suggest the SCP has not in practice reduced labour supply, including for secondary earners. Taken together, the evidence suggests that concerns that the SCP creates work disincentives are overplayed.
